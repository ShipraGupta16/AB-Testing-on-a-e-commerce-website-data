This repository is a part of Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree Project. 

Introduction

A/B-testing have recently become very popular due to their capability to compare 
the performance of two objects or situations depending upon a chosen metric. 
This current example of A/B-testing includes the conversion rates between new 
and old websites for an e-commerce website. Basically, we have to test whether 
they should implement the new page, or keep the old page or run the experiment 
longer to make their decision.
